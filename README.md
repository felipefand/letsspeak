# Let's Speak

## Actitivy

You have been hired by the language school "Let's Speak" to build a dictionary application for the students.

The application should be built according to the following requirements:

The application should store terms and their meanings. Terms can consist of one or more words (for example, in the case of phrasal verbs and idiomatic expressions).

- The application should allow the student to input new terms whenever they deem it necessary. The application should enable the search for terms, without distinguishing between uppercase and lowercase letters.
- The search should only be performed on the terms (it should not search in the definitions). When no matching term is found in the search, the application should display the message "No term found" on the screen.
- Otherwise, all terms that match the searched word should be displayed. The application should not accept wildcards (* and ?); the search will be conducted using complete words or parts of words.
  - *For example, when searching for "pea," the system should return terms like "speak," "pear," "peacock," "spears," etc.*
- The application should save the data in a file on the disk so that, when it is started, all the saved terms are loaded.
